      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>
        My name is Antero Lindell. I am a programmer, a professional nerd, and a man of several talents. I studied at
        Metropolia UAS majoring in Game Development. I am particularly experienced in game engine design, low-level
        programming languages, graphics APIs, and
        multimedia libraries such as OpenGL, WebGPU, SDL, Raylib, DirectX, and Vulkan.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although I am a game developer by trade, my expertise is not limited to only that. I love learning new things
        and broadening my knowledge, so I consider myself somewhat of a "Jack of All Trades" — which is why I strongly
        agree with the quote:
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>"A jack of all trades is a master of none but often better than a master of one."</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        My journey into technology started at the very young age of 5 when my dad taught me how to use our family
        computer running Windows ME. Since then, I've been fascinated by all kinds of machinery and electronics.
      </p>
      <p>
        My first experience with programming came at the age of 12 when I started making Flash games with Adobe's
        ActionScript 2.0, which resembled today’s JavaScript. I was also heavily involved in the video game modding
        scene — particularly for GTA San Andreas — using a scripting language called CLEO, which had a syntax similar to
        BASIC. Shortly afterward, I moved on to Java and C#, eventually discovering C and C++, which remain my most-used
        languages today.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've always known that working with technology is my calling and passion — something I will continue to pursue
        in my career.
